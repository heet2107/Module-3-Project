How does the internet work? • The internet is a worldwide computer network that transmits a variety of data and media across interconnected devices. It works by using a packet routing network that follows Internet Protocol (IP) and Transport Control Protocol (TCP).?• When data is transferred over the internet, it’s delivered in messages and packets. Data sent over the internet is called a message, but before messages get sent, they’re broken up into tinier parts called packets.?• Using a numerical address (IP Address) the IP system receives further instructions on how the data should be transferred.?• When we type in a web address, known as a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). Each website has its own unique URL that signals to your ISP where you want to go.?• Your query is pushed to your ISP which connects to several servers which store and send data like a NAP Server (Network Access Protection) and a DNS (Domain Name Server).• Example: IP address of Google.com becomes 64.233.191.255?• Your browser sends a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request to the target server to send a copy of the website to the client using TCP/IP.• The server then approves request and sends a “200 OK” message to your computer. Then, the server sends website files to the browser in the form of data packets.• As your browser reassembles the data packets, the website loads allowing you to learn, shop, browse, and engage.????What happens when you click on a link?  When we click on link, it breaks down into three different components1. Method2. Path3. Protocol Version?The browser and operating system figure out where you've clicked. The web page that you're viewing has hidden information associated with whatever you clicked on.
